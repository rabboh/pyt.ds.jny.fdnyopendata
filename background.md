# Background information - NYFD
I have collected this information about Fire Department of New York City and about NYC in order to better understand the data set.

New York City is divided to five boroughs. They are The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island. Borough is a type of municipality. Each borough elects a borough president, who in turn appoints some members of local community boards. The boroughs of New York City are generally treated as separate counties for judicial purposes and for some legal filings. (Wikipedia)
